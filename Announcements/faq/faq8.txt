>>> **Where do CryptoStykz come from?**

CryptoStykz NFTs come from an era when stickfigure animations/games dominated the internet in the early-mid 2000's. On the forums DarkDemon and Droidz, these exact figures were shared and used extensively across the animating community. Only a few people in the world still have access to the original files. Many of the CryptoStykz figures were created and used by highly respected animators on the forums, such as Jon, Bert, Picto, TRGG, and more.. Their long lost animations can be found [here](https://opensea.io/collection/darkdemonz)
